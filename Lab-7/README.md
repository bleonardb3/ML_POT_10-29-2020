# Lab-7 - Build, Train, Save, Deploy, and Test a Neural Network Model using Watson Machine Learning 

## Introduction:
This lab will use the MNIST computer vision data set to train a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits. A simple convolutional neural network built using Keras will be submitted to Watson Machine Learning for training. The trained model will be saved in the model repository, deployed, and scored. The lab will use a notebook to programmatically accomplish these tasks. 

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Set up the data and result buckets in IBM Cloud Storage
1. Configure the training definition 
1. Train the model
1. Monitor the training progress and results.  
1. Save and Deploy the trained model 
1. Test the model with 2 image samples.
